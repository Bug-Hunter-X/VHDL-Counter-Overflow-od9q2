This repository contains a VHDL counter with a potential overflow bug and its corrected version. The buggy counter increments without handling overflow, while the fixed counter includes a check to prevent this issue.  The original code exhibits an uncommon error, which is the implicit wrap-around behavior of the counter without explicit saturation handling. This can lead to unexpected behavior in certain applications where a clear indication of maximum value is required rather than a wrap-around condition.
